## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
mutant_moneyball <- 
  readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-03-19/mutant_moneyball.csv')

```

```{r}
view(mutant_moneyball)
```

look at price per issue for ebay and PPI for wiz -- wiz is a price guide, while ebay shows real data 

first we're cleaning up data to get rid of 

```{r}
test <- mutant_moneyball |> 
  mutate(across('60s_Appearance_Percent':PPI90s_oStreet, parse_number))
#mutate(PPI60s_ebay = parse_number(PPI60s_ebay))
```
