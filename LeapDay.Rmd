## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
events <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-02-27/events.csv')
births <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-02-27/births.csv')
deaths <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-02-27/deaths.csv')
```

```{r}
births <- births |>
  separate(person, c("Fname", "Lname"))
```



```{r}
leap_names <- births |> 
  group_by(Fname) |> 
  summarize(count = n()) |> 
  filter(count >= 2)

leap_names


#leap_births <- babynames |> 
  #filter(year > 1920) |> 
  #filter(name %in% leap_names$Fname) |> 
  #group_by(name, year) |> 
  #mutate(diff = n - log(n), 
  
  
```

```{r}
leap_births |> 
  ggplot(aes(x =year, y =n)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = name, lty = sex)) +
  geom_point(data = filter(births, Fname %in% leap_names%Fname),
             aes(color = Fname, x = year_birth), y = 75000, size= 5)+
  xlim()
  
```
